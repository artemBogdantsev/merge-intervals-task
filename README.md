# Introduction
A code challenge task

## Input
A list of closed intervals, e.g. [2,19] [25,30] [14,23] [4,8]

**Note:** in a context of the picked language I assume that by interval I accept start and end coordinates of this interval. The interval is supposed to be closed therefor the start/end points are counted. 

## Output
A list of merged intervals, e.g. [2,23] [25, 30]
